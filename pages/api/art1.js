        info: "The compositions of Kuntal Dutta have an air of magical realism. His sources of inspiration are real life things that one would observe every day. He draws houses that are part of a town, a tree, a bird or the moon which is a source of admiration for everyone. Yet the way he portrays these simple objects gives his canvas a magical quality as his brushstrokes are not precise rather they create a haziness which instead of distorting the picture gives it a surreal quality. He uses muted colours to paint this dream like world where everything looks merged together yet everything creates its own separate impression. He has a knack for giving a magical quality to the commonplace while making the magical a part of everyday life. In his artistic gaze the magical and the real merge to create a tangible symphony. .",

        info: "Otherworlds explores the complex & exploitative labour and class relationships in Kapashera - a tenement town that lies at the cusp of Delhi and Gurugram. It questions the meaning of home for people in a place that is in a perpetual state of flux and how the temporariness of livelihoods and belonging affects the lives of women in this space. For Otherworlds, Nitin and Sumedha started out by repurposing an old abandoned warehouse in Kapashera to create a space which the women could view as a safe space for daily conversations.",

        info: "George Bataille introduced the notion of 'l'informe' - Formlessness. What Bataille means by Formlessness is that art should be brought down to earth, off of its pedestal where it has been standing since antiquity. For Bataille, creativity is in the process. The Formless, in a way, is abstract and indefinable - Bataille himself claims that a word has no definition. It is performative, rather than explanatory. In this exhibition, it is explored how these artists transcend from form to formlessness in their art. We also get to notice that each artist uses diverse mediums and techniques to define their expressions.",

His works delve into and empathetically depict the complex emotions and embattled lives of the transgender subjects who, though historically an integral part of Indian society and culture, are seldom recognized as such and rather treated with ambivalence at best and rejection at worst.

        info: "The world of Indira Halder is crowded with men and women who are depicted in muted colours. Her painting reminds one of the forgotten art forms of the marginalised tribal lands. By drawing from these art forms Haldar is able to bring these otherwise forgotten art into the public eye. She uses subdued colours and white is often a primary colour. The subjects of her paintings are ordinary moments like a group of women gossiping. At times she is inspired by the natural landscape which abounds in animals and flowers. But haldar's paintings show a knack for presenting the normal in a peculiar way which makes her viewers question their own version of reality.",

The iron nails form the base of this piece which refers to a creature which looks like it is part of the moist earth. The metal which changed the face of civilizations with its strength is combined with the nail whose purpose is to hold things together. So what is the purpose of these nails which are just hammered in at random? The folds of the sculpture part to reveal a creature with marks resembling a lowly worm.",

Her works of landscape depict the buildings which are sharp and geometric, the futuristic technology is sleek but textured, the landscape is barren and foreboding often resembling a scene from a dystopian future. Within her inconsequential works, Mandal tries to create parallels between functionality in the cosmic space and the nerve synapses of the human brain rendering in harmonious rhythms.",
