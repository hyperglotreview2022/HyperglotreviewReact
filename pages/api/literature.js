  info:["A fictional narrative which traverses between historical accounts, social commentary and a fictional storyline might seem daunting and, perhaps, tedious to some writers. Debarati Mukhopadhyay traverses these seemingly incongruent aspects with effortless ease. The setting changes within a few pages from Nobokishore Dutta's compound in Mechhuabajar in Calcutta to Mowshaat, formerly known as Bishwanathpur within the historical backdrop of the latter half of the nineteenth century at a heightened pace of unsettling drama concerning Krishnoshundor's family. The poignancy of Bhubonmoni's excruciating plight is depicted by the judgement she has to face from the male bastions of society who also have the sole right to debate and determine her fate for being raped. The self-appointed standard bearers of morality cannot wait to rid the village of her and, by extension, Krishnoshundor's family because his brother married a heathen. The proposal to save her soul as laid down in the 'shaastor' is gratuitously provided by the lecherous Paachkori Mukhopadhyay who wishes to ravage her for thirty nights as penance for her transgression of being violated by non-believers. Only then can Bhubonmoni regain her place as a brahmin and be reintegrated into society. Torn between his efforts to ensure that his children are not treated as social pariahs and rescuing his sister from the ravenous intentions of Paachkori, Krishnoshundor envisages the conniving Horihor as heaven sent and falls into his trap. The novel creates a startlingly refreshing displacement of the moral latitude enjoyed by the privileged male members of the times with potent perspicacity. A translation from the original Bengali novel might not capture the depth and scale of the many lives and worlds conceived by the author. Arunava Sinha effortlessly moves between these peripheries effortlessly and demonstrates that in the hands of an adept translator, a wonderful work can occupy similar spaces in the original as in the language of its translation."],
  summary:["When unspeakable tragedy befalls Bhubonmoni, a young widow, she must leave her village along with her brother, Krishnoshundor, and his family. Ensnared by the wily entrepreneur Nobokishore Dutta, they end up in an overcrowded depot near a port, soon to be packed into a ship sailing to Surinam, where they will be sold as sugarcane plantation slaves. But Fate has other plans. Bhubonmoni finds herself being led away from the port and her family to be stowed away in a secret location in Calcutta. Not too far away, a young rebel Shourendro is swept up by the ideas of the Brahmo Samaj. Meanwhile in Metiabruz, a shy musician Chondronath impresses the exiled Nawab of Lucknow with his art. None of them know it yet, but the stars are aligning despite overwhelming odds for them to meet under curious circumstances...Set against the vibrant background of late nineteenth-century Bengal, Debarati Mukhopadhyay's beautifully woven novel brings together the glory and the decadence of colonial times. Fast-paced and thrilling, with a lively cast of characters including historical figures such as Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, Rabindranath Tagore, and Dr Kadambini Ganguly, Chronicles of the Lost Daughters is an unforgettable saga"],

info:["When an adept marketeer writes books, the result is a book such as 'The Big Bang of Numbers'. Everything from the title itself to the introduction cheekily subtitled 'The Poper Made Me Write This Book' promises to be a fascinating read even for a subject that is revered by the millions but billions find intimidating, to put it mildly. For a late bloomer like myself who started appreciating mathematics only after those excruciating experiences with high school algebra, trigonometry and calculus, mathematics now seems to be the forbidden love affair from one's childhood, and adolescence, that could not be consummated due to extraneous factors. So, any new book on the philosophy of science or mathematics is always a means to rekindle that flame reinforced by that sense of hapless nostalgia. As book progresses, the ambitious, albeit unoriginal, project hailed as 'creatio ex nihilio' (creation out of nothing) seems to fall way short of expectations. To borrow from Shakespeare's Macbeth, the book ends up being a marketing pitch that is 'full of sound and fury' and very little substance. Suri's work seems to have distant echoes of Terence Tao's 'Analysis I', where the latter too undertakes the task of building all the axioms of arithmetic, more precisely, number theory and set theory from the simplest axioms in the first two chapters. To his credit, Suri has changed the order of these two branches of mathematics, making it more accessible to the uninitiated. Here's to hoping that the rest of the book has more substance and doesn't leave a reader who really wanted to like, no, love the book on the subject whose wonders he would've liked to explore during his formative years."],
summary:["An engaging and imaginative tour through the fundamental mathematical concepts—from arithmetic to infinity—that form the building blocks of our universe. Our universe has multiple origin stories, from religious creation myths to the Big Bang of scientists. But if we leave those behind and start from nothing—no matter, no cosmos, not even empty space—could we create a universe using only math? Irreverent, richly illustrated, and boundlessly creative, The Big Bang of Numbers invites us to try. In this new mathematical origin story, mathematician and novelist Manil Suri creates a natural progression of ideas needed to design our world, starting with numbers and continuing through geometry, algebra, and beyond. He reveals the secret lives of real and imaginary numbers, teaches them to play abstract games with real-world applications, discovers unexpected patterns that connect humble lifeforms to enormous galaxies, and explores mathematical underpinnings for randomness and beauty. With evocative examples ranging from multidimensional crochet to the Mona Lisa's asymmetrical smile, as well as ingenious storytelling that helps illuminate complex concepts like infinity and relativity, The Big Bang of Numbers charts a playful, inventive course to existence. Mathematics, Suri shows, might best be understood not as something we invent to explain Nature, but as the source of all creation, whose directives Nature tries to obey as best she can. Offering both striking new perspectives for math aficionados and an accessible introduction for anyone daunted by calculation, The Big Bang of Numbers proves that we can all fall in love with math."]

info:["Translations can often seem tedious due to entrenched cultural and linguistic barriers. Amar Mitra's novel is a confluence of resplendent folklore and gruesome socio-political realities. From the first page itself, he has effortlessly imbued the magical realism narrative framework with the ingenuity of a vibrant imagination. The novel proceeds in the form of an oddly invigorating cyclical and hypnotical structure moving from one page to the next with the lethargic yet graceful, almost imperceptible movement of a danseuse not even once letting the reader's attention wander or slip for even a fraction of a moment. The fisherfolk of Dhanapati's island congregate from the months of Ashwin to Chaitra according to the Bengali calendar. Dhanapati is the name of the island, as well as of Dhanapati, the oldest inhabitant of the island, and, according to some accounts, that of its first inhabitant though the current Dhanapati vehemently disagrees that there has been anyone else before him. Vagabonds like Batashi have a home for six months of the year where they arrive emaciated and then during their stay are rejuvenated in body and spirit turning into voluptuous beings who become the object of lustful villainy of the trader Dasharath Singh. The inescapable avarice and corruption of the law enforcers as embodied by the police constable Mangal Midde and the violence inflicted on the poor and neglected strays of society is highlighted with razor-sharp precision. It will be difficult to find a voice that is more brutal about socio-economic realities yet so humane while presenting the most heinous atrocities that people nourished and nurtured by the same piece of earth and sky are capable of inflicting upon each other."],
summary:["The island came out of the golden pot of Ma Kamala, which she gave to the pirate Pedru to rule. However, there are mythical and mystical elements to the story about how Dhanapati is not only the village headman but also the giant tortoise of lore that swam in from depths of the oceans and fell asleep here to be seen when the waters recede in the winter months. Dhanapati was the last Pedru, but he was now old and blind, unable to rule his island for long. He then gifted it to his seventeen-year-old wife, Kunti. Will Dhaneshwari, the new ruler, be able to save the island and its women from the lustful eyes of the administration? Or will the government acquire the island? Or will Kunti be able to cast her spell and get the old tortoise to float away with the island on his back? The Island of Dhanapatir combines the elements of myth, allegory and magic realism with a folklore of rare beauty."]

info:["Vasudhendra has assayed a novel that is monumental in scale and it takes immense daring to conceive of such a undertaking. The novel oscillates between the backdrop of the Tejo in Portugal during the Renaissance and the banks of the Tungabhadra in the Vijaynagara Empire. Gabriel and Bella are young lovers caught in the web of an entrenched antisemitic social setting with the economic disparity between their families proving to be as insurmountable an obstacle towards their marriage as much as religious opposition. On the other hand, Belsham and Antonio's friendship is also tested when Queen Isabella of Spain insists upon the forced conversion of the Jewish community for her daughter's marriage with King Manuel. The lovers are caught in the midst of the tumultuous tide that threatens to have a cataclysmic effect on their lives. Humiliated by his beloved's father due to his family's modest economic situation, Gabriel decides to risk his life by embarking on a voyage to India. This is where the scene shifts to the Vijaynagara Empire. One can only wonder that if the setting that was less familiar to the author was presented with such palpable vividness, to what extent will the reader be swept away when the narrative resumes in the historical grandeur of the author's homeland?"],
summary:["Tejo Tungabhadra tells the story of two rivers on different continents whose souls are bound together by history. On the banks of the river Tejo in Lisbon, Bella, a young Jewish refugee, and her family face daily threats to their lives and dignity from the deeply antisemitic society around them. Gabriel, her lover, sails to India with General Albuquerque's fleet seeking wealth and a secure future for themselves. Meanwhile, on the banks of the Tungabhadra in the Vijayanagara Empire, the young couple Hampamma and Keshava find themselves caught in the storm of religious violence and the cruel rigmarole of tradition. The two stories converge in Goa with all the thunder and gush of meeting rivers. Set in the late 15th and early 16th century, Tejo Tungabhadra is a grand saga of love, ambition, greed, and a deep zest for life through the tossing waves of history."],

info:["While exploring the desires of different strata of Indian women in her book, Shrayana Bhattacharya places at the centre of it a sociological investigation on the rampant social and economic disparity between men and women. Desperately Seeking Shahrukh is an intelligent blend of an empathetic observation of the lives of Indian women and an objective statistical analysis of the gendered nature of our economy. Bhattacharya acknowledges the plurality of the world created in Shah Rukh's films. It is romantic and patriarchal; idealistic and regressive. Despite this convergence of seemingly opposing views, women yearn for a man like Shah Rukh for his emotional vulnerability and the lofty romantic standards he sets for his female viewers. Shah Rukh is a representation of their aspirational identity; their quiet pursuit for freedom, vulnerability and equity of treatment in personal and public spheres."],
summary:["In this path breaking work, Shrayana Bhattacharya maps the economic and personal trajectories--the jobs, desires, prayers, love affairs and rivalries--of a diverse group of women. Divided by class but united in fandom, they remain steadfast in their search for intimacy, independence and fun. Embracing Hindi film idol Shah Rukh Khan allows them a small respite from an oppressive culture, a fillip to their fantasies of a friendlier masculinity in Indian men. Most struggle to find the freedom-or income-to follow their favourite actor. Bobbing along in this stream of multiple lives for more than a decade-from Manju's boredom in 'rurban' Rampur and Gold's anger at having to compete with Western women for male attention in Delhi's nightclubs, to Zahira's break from domestic abuse in Ahmedabad-Bhattacharya gleans the details on what Indian women think about men, money, movies, beauty, helplessness, agency and love. A most unusual and compelling book on the female gaze, this is the story of how women have experienced post-liberalization India."],

Untouched by the rapid development in the nearby capital city, Teetarpur in 2017 is revelling in its anonymity and rejoicing the fact that all its inhabitants live an unimaginative life. Clearly this is a place where everyone knows everyone and nothing much happens or is expected to happen. Amidst all this the author introduces the character of Munia, a young girl celebrating her eighth birthday with icecream. In a place where time stands still Munia is an explorer who has created her own world of innocence as well as imagination. But then this is not the story of Munia; rather it is a story of how this spell of time standing still is broken in Teetarpur by a death which shakes the very core of this tiny community. Roy has cleverly created a space where a murder is the least likely thing to happen hence when it happens we are left with several questions and this death certainly wakes everyone out of their slumber. Suddenly the entire community must come to terms with this unnatural death that has occurred and a handful of policemen who are used to sleeping on duty are pushed into rounding up possible suspects and looking for clues. Roy has masterfully weaved a mystery which promises to be a page turner by creating chaos amidst peace. By adding the ingredient of doubt and uncertainty Roy dispels the myth of harmony that surrounds small towns and the readers can look forward to the unmasking of each character."],
summary:["In the village of Teetarpur, a few hours from the capital city of Delhi, Chand's peaceful life is shattered as he is forced into a dangerous quest for justice. At the station house, the jurisdiction of which extends to Teetarpur and the neighbouring villages, Sub-inspector Ombir Singh, who has known Chand's daughter Munia since she was born, wrestles with his conscience and the vagaries of his personal life as the increasingly murky case unfolds under the watchful eyes of the 'Delhi boy', SSP Pilania. Meanwhile, in the rough bylanes of Bright Dairy Colony, Chand's old companions Rabia and Badshah Miyan fight for their right to home and country as the politics of religion threaten to overwhelm their lives. Framed as a police procedural, Black River is fast-paced and relentless, yet tender and reflective, in its exploration of friendship, love and grief. 'A riveting murder mystery. A psychological thriller. A magnificent work of literary fiction. Roy brings her formidable experience as a journalist to this story of crime in modern India. Black River addresses a society unravelling in the midst of change, a brutal class divide, the terror of religious strife, relentless violence against women—but it is also suffused with tenderness for the ordinary, heroic decency of those who persist in abiding by different rules.

info:["Janice Pariat's work is a plethora of heartwarming episodes with endearing characters starting with the narrator Shai, her father, Kima and, of course, the indomitable Oiñ. Jaded and with 'no inner compass', Shai travels from the capital fleeing from the air and as revealed through her inner dialogue 'because something---I don't know what---has been lost.' This raises her mother's suspicions which she finds almost stifling upon arriving home but the hills of Shillong act like a panacea for her existential angst as she starts breathing in the untainted air and soaking up the intermittent but rejuvenating spells of sunlight during her meanderings through the forest. Her father's remarkable knowledge of trees almost verges on a metaphysical connection with nature as he unequivocally propagates that humanity's 'gravest crime' is our 'plant bias---the tendency to underappreciate or ignore the flora around us'. The novel also provides a glimpse of Shillong in a state of transition and how one of its famous rooftop cafés has imitated a design that is reminiscent of a city café instead of adopting the traditional natural aesthetics. Then comes one of the defining moments of the novel, a bildungsroman adventure for Shia who decides to visit Oiñ by embarking on what turns out to be an extremely unnerving prospect for someone who has explored almost nothing of Meghalaya's rural, almost idyllic locales. Pariat is a seasoned writer, yet, her writing is as rejuvenating as the hills of Shillong, free from affections and rich in a mystical exploration of people and their natural environs."],
summary:["As emotionally resonant as Kiran Desai's The Inheritance of Loss, as inspired as Anthony Doerr's Cloud Cuckoo Land, as inventive as Louisa Hall's Speak, and as visionary as David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, Everything the Light Touches is Janice Pariat's magnificent epic of travelers, of discovery, of time, of science, of human connection, and of the impermanent nature of the universe and life itself—a bold and brilliant saga that unfolds through the adventures and experiences of four intriguing characters. Shai is a young woman in modern India. Lost and drifting, she travels to her country's Northeast and rediscovers, through her encounters with indigenous communities, ways of being that realign and renew her. Evelyn is a student of science in Edwardian England. Inspired by Goethe's botanical writings, she leaves Cambridge on a quest to wander the sacred forests of the Lower Himalayas. Linnaeus, a botanist and taxonomist who famously declared “God creates; Linnaeus organizes,” sets off on an expedition to an unfamiliar world, the far reaches of Lapland in 1732. Goethe is a philosopher, writer, and one of the greatest minds of his age. While traveling through Italy in the 1780s, he formulates his ideas for “The Metamorphosis of Plants,” a little-known, revelatory text that challenges humankind's propensity to reduce plants—and the world—into immutable parts. Drawn richly from scientific and botanical ideas, Everything the Light Touches is a swirl of ever-expanding themes: the contrasts between modern India and its colonial past, urban and rural life, capitalism and centuries-old traditions of generosity and gratitude, script and “song and stone.” Pulsating at its center is the dichotomy between different ways of seeing, those that fix and categorize and those that free and unify. Pariat questions the imposition of fixity—of our obsession to place permanence on plants, people, stories, knowledge, land—where there is only movement, fluidity, and constant transformation. “To be still,” says a character in the book, “is to be without life.” Everything the Light Touches brings together, with startling and playful novelty, people and places that seem, at first, removed from each other in time and place. Yet as it artfully reveals, all is resonance; all is connection."],

The leitmotif of his book is an organism's Umwelt --- its 'sensory bubble' or 'perceptual world' --- is both poetic and a recursively hypnotic narrative technique. If Carl Sagan was a master of storytelling about the cosmos, Yong is his successor in the hidden sensory realms around us. He compares tremendous olfactory capabilities of dogs to that of humans in a fascinating way only to debunk the myth that scientific basis for such comparison can be misleading. The vivid description of how crucial pheromones are to the ant's existence makes it almost unputdownable and you find yourself fighting the urge to sleep even at 2 am in the morning.

This is his first book, but at the risk of sounding repetitive, like Sagan, Yong evokes the impulse to rush through his book only to pick up his next, or as in the latter case, his previous one.

summary:["The Earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. But every animal is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense world. This book welcomes us into a previously unfathomable dimension--the world as it is truly perceived by other animals. We encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth's magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and humans that wield sonar like bats. We discover that a crocodile's scaly face is as sensitive as a lover's fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision. We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. We listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries which lie unsolved. In An Immense World, author and acclaimed science journalist Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. Because in order to understand our world we don't need to travel to other places; we need to see through other eyes."],
