        info: ["Rakhi Peswani, an artist and art instructor, investigates the connection between stitching and drawing in her work. By combining the traditions of minimalism and figurative art with weaving and sewing to create intricate forms and ideas, Peswani dismantles the hierarchy that places art above craft, painting above stitching, and sewing above sculpture. Peswani was initially interested in needlework as a hobby and a method to make gifts for her friends. Later, she switched from embroidery to sewing as the foundation of her artistic practice. Since then, she has created a sophisticated collection of work that investigates the relationship between the body, language, and craft.","Peswani, who was born in New Delhi in 1977, was raised all across India due to her father's military employment. She moved every three years and was exposed to a range of cultural activities, such as traditional bamboo weaving in Assam and block printing in Rajasthan. Peswani's mother served as her first mentor in this field, introducing her to the marvel of handmade processes. Thus, Making things by hand was a big part of her upbringing.","Peswani was inspired by the chaotic and even brutal transformation Indian cities go through as they develop into major metropolises. Her multilayered works, which examine the shifting motivations to produce and consume art in these cities, reflect the discrepancies that have never been resolved and the ongoing push and pull encountered between producer and consumer markets. Peswani intently examines nature in order to rediscover herself. Peswani combines her passion of large-scale sculpting, painting, and sketching to create forms that reveal a profoundly expressive inner world motivated by intuition and emotion. She works closely with materials like jute fibre, waste cotton, and natural pigments."],

It questions the meaning of home for people in a place that is in a perpetual state of flux and how the temporariness of livelihoods and belonging affects the lives of women in this space. For Otherworlds, Nitin and Sumedha started out by repurposing an old abandoned warehouse in Kapashera to create a space which the women could view as a safe space for daily conversations. Proximity to garment factories meant they had access to a wide range of leftover pieces of cloth in all colours and shapes, and the gendered nature of the chore of sewing comfortably allowed the women to immerse themselves in this activity. What began on the scale of the intimate and domestic, expanded into a larger project when the women started challenging the cadastral map of Kapashera and its patriarchal representation of space. They began to create a 6 metre long and 3 metre high tapestry that allowed them to reimagine their own understanding of the space and their ideas of identity, belonging, displacement and loss.","Settlements like Kapashera have emerged through their entanglement with an ecology of planetary fast fashion. They wanted to collectively reflect on this ecology with the women's collective from the community. They decided to use the cadastral map of Kapashera, a tool which allows patriarchal control over the settlement of Kapashera as a figure for the collective tapestry. Over the months of September to November 2019, the seven sisters women's collective produced a collective tapestry which reflects on these planetary entanglement of Kapashera and explores alternative narratives of its transformation and entanglements with the life stories of the migrants."],

The Formless, in a way, is abstract and indefinable - Bataille himself claims that a word has no definition. It is performative, rather than explanatory. In this exhibition, it is explored how these artists transcend from form to formlessness in their art. We also get to notice that each artist uses diverse mediums and techniques to define their expressions.","MASOOM KSHETRIMAYUM - My imagery focuses on visual metaphor and illusion of visible reality. The practice is gradually developing due to the change in the surroundings, life and events I encounter. I am looking at the relationship between dissimilar existences of my visual reference which comes from my subconscious mind even before I could recognize it. Intentionally, I omit the unnecessary details and draw it with repetitive shapes and lines. It is an act of tearing apart objects into emotional states and aesthetic consciousness. Through it, I am developing a new blurred hybrid visual, which expands through the different stages of curiosity, reality and desire. Being an abstract artist, my works take the form of the city landscape as metaphor of shared human experience and constant change, where I am interested in tracking the pattern, colors, formation and the essence of real and virtual memories. My metaphorical depiction is my response to evoke empathy, both imagined and witnessed."],

The township quickly turned into a concrete jungle, leaving few signs of its former natural state. This had an impact on her paintings, which expertly blend the landscapes of the old and new cities. In some of the pieces, a bird, a broken window, or a brick wall will occasionally poke their heads out of the mossy colour and mouldy texture. Her works in the shape of paper scrolls continue to be original in their conceptions and execution because she developed her own art-making procedures and used organic materials and different types of papers. Chakravarty describes her writing as autobiographical and surreal, creating her own distinctive idiom to convey concepts of truth, nature, and unity. She frequently tries out different organic materials, including paper, rice paper, tissue, and cellophane, to create fluid, transparent images that are open to various interpretations.","Chakravarty employs superimposed forms in her artwork, emulating the sketches made by cave painters before they mapped them on cave walls. She contends that interacting with people from foreign lands and a different culture broadened her perspective and made her reconsider some of her preconceived notions. The ink-on-paper sketches of Chakravarty are an experiment in turning subjective experience into mystical truth.","She completed her Master's at The Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda's Faculty of Fine Arts, where she was exposed to an urban sensibility. She was also an artist-in-residence in Aix-en-Provence from 1993 to 1995, when she had conversations with several of the group members and was affected by the French movement Supports/Surfaces throughout the early years of her practise. Jayashree has held exhibitions both domestically and internationally, including presentations at the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), Singapore, the Chicago Cultural Center, Illinois, USA, and the Musee Departemental Des Arts Asiatiques Nice, France. Her most recent exhibits have been in the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, the Musée Guimet in Paris, the Palazzo Madama in Turin, Italy, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in Mumbai, and the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in Noida and New Delhi."],

Banerjee's artwork promotes diversity on a material level by utilising a range of materials, such as African tribal jewellery, vibrant feathers, light bulbs, and Murano glass. These sensuous assemblages, which thrive on tensions between visual cultures and pose issues with exoticism, cultural appropriation, globalisation, and feminism, show themselves as both familiar and foreign at the same time.","Her larger body of work, which questions contemporary nationalist political ideologies, suggests that identity is multifaceted and not solely focused on a person's culture of origin or gender but also on self-identification. The fragmented figures, wild use of colour, and symbolic materials that characterise Banerjee's constantly developing work all reflect these open-ended and liberating concepts of the 'self.' Banerjee's works continuously challenge modern approaches to artistic creation and social involvement, which are paired with their provocative and poetic titles.","The San José Museum of Art and Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts collaborated to co-organize Rina Banerjee's first solo retrospective, Make Me a Summary of the World, which featured 60 sculptures, paintings, and videos. Banerjee has also participated in 14 biennial exhibitions globally, including the 57th Venice Biennale, the Yokohama Triennale, and the Kochi Biennial.

This art of printing not only makes the journey highly enriching, it also brings forth the joy and excitement of a hands-on process.

He also employs byproducts of human activity and wasted material in new ways. The distortion of structure slows the act of perception between the audience and the object. In this way, his art fulfils the poetic purpose of encouraging interpretation rather than recognising something that is already well-known and familiar.","Although his medium is always changing, his fundamental concern—a critical commentary on contemporary society—remains the same. With his sculpture 'Gift,' a mosaic of pouches filled with urine, sweat, tears, and formaldehyde, he condemns the slaughter of unwanted girl foetuses, who like urine and sweat are readily flushed out by the system in which they reside. The melting form in one of his nameless sculpture, which resembles a boy made of stale chocolate, represents lives in their never-ending process of becoming rather than existing.","Pandey's artworks are the outcome of much internal and external exploration. He typically employs a conceptual approach when dealing with memories, nostalgia, and life and death. In order to create the art he wants, he experiments with various materials.

The artist claims 'art saved me in so many ways.' Motivated by urgent questions about her brown body's place in the world, and inspired by other feminist artists such as Mona Hatoum and Louise Bourgeois, the artist's earlier 'doodles' evolved into artworks on paper based on anatomy and discovered object assemblages, through which she discovered a vocabulary of questioning identity and gender politics.","At the Summer Academy in Salzburg, she completed her apprenticeship under the German artist Bernhard Martin.

And nowhere is all this more apparent than the vibrant country that Sri Lanka is. It has a multitude of overlapping and cultural trajectories, where many languages, religions, and historical communities coexist. She said in an interview that “the rented houses of my life have had the greatest impact on my work. All through my childhood my family migrated from one place to another, creating an alarming degree of confusion in me, in terms of how I would relate or connect with my new surroundings and new community…I experienced considerable difficulty in connecting and categorising myself within each one of these newly moved into communities, it raised questions and even then, forced me to look at the idea of belonging”.","Shironi also uses cartography in her work where she depicts the trauma that remains embedded in the landscapes of the north of her country that was ravaged by civil war. It was in 2016, that Shironi completed her BFA (Visual Art), from Ramanathan Fine Arts Academy - University of Jaffna, Sri Lanka. Later, she completed her MFA at Beacon House National University, Lahore. The life and experiences of the two countries she has lived and studied in - Sri Lanka and Pakistan - is evident in her work. In her art, there is nostalgia for places where she has lived for short periods of time. Coupled with her keen eye for the history of colonization, civil war, displacement and migration, which she highlights through personal stories and experiences, Shironi's art is at once a climax of emotions taking us on a journey of her migratory routes where she explores political themes around the subjects of domesticity, language, culture, memory, religious myths, gender politics, tenacity and fragility.","This movement from one place to another in her childhood has become the underlying theme and the foundation of her works. She goes to the roots of traditional roles set in place through our language and cultural tradition, our religion and mythologies, and accepted gender roles. What makes her works different is the use of simple and yet defining elements. Appearing as threads and partitions, these elements are often the sculptures and installations of her interdisciplinary work. National flags and religious imagery are dissected to reveal not just similar structural principles but the uncertainties that bring them together."],

This fluidity captures the sense of movement in a piece which is otherwise forced to stay in a predetermined space.","His works are a reflection of an artist who captures the possibility of movement beyond the defined parameters of convention. While there is a clear influence of traditional Indian aesthetics and motifs in his earlier works, he has moved beyond it to encapsulate a more global influence. This creates a unique juxtaposition of the traditional and the modern in his art as he continues to work with local craftsmen and revive traditional art forms. His works defy categorisation since he works with metal, mostly brass, which adds a thread of continuity to his pieces. His choice of metal is also deliberate since brass is traditionally used in Indian rituals. However, the artist uses the same metal to create pieces which are abstract and elude definitions.

Classes of art training during his time at the university expanded his knowledge and he immersed himself in the history of art of the world.","After returning to his home country, Senanayake started painting fulltime and gradually became one of the region's important living artists.

In fact, a number of his works attempt to make viewers aware of the problem. Senanayake says, My main focus is on the endangered flora and fauna in our rainforests.

The complexity of Burman's characters, inspired from old European and Indian cultural values, exist in a dream-like vivid and surreal world. Sakti Burman has also created a number of graphics, including a collection of sixteen limited edition lithographs that serve as illustrations for Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali in addition to his oil and watercolour paintings. The artist made and displayed a significant collection of bronze sculpture in 2009 after dabbling with wood carving in the 1970s.","Burman creates works on paper and canvas that resemble frescoes using pointillism and a marbling method that involves mixing oils and acrylics. Burman frequently references many points in time and space in his paintings, giving them a surrealist aspect. His marbling method, which he developed after years of experimenting, is largely responsible for his distinctive body of work. When Burman visited Italy in 1958, he was inspired to incorporate the monumentality and textures of the frescoes by Giotto, Piero de la France, and Simone Martini into his artwork.","Burman was born in Kolkata in 1935. He received his education at the Government College of Arts and Crafts in Kolkata before moving on to Paris to attend the École Nationale des Beaux Arts. In 1954, the artist held his first solo exhibition in Kolkata. Since then, he has held numerous exhibitions in cities all over the world, including Galerie des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Piccadilly Gallery in London, Galerie Doucet et Coutureau in Paris, Galleria Nuovo Sagittario in Milan, and Galerie Sagar in Zurich. He splits his time between Delhi and Paris.","'Life is a Theatre', a collection of Sakti Burman's artwork, will be presented by Art Alive Gallery at India Art Fair. The performance includes contemporary pieces by Burman, in which he uses humour to construct a fantastical universe where real life emulates theatre. His diverse background and interests give his paintings a distinctive blend of French and Indian culture, signifying a cultural link between these two different nations."],

        info: ["Young Debashish Paul, the India Art Fair artist-in-residence, grew up seeing his sisters and sisters-in-law doing what normal village women in Bengal do: sew, stitch and, most important, play dress up. At Phulia village in West Bengal's Nadia district - well-known for its spiritual links with Krishna -- Paul was immersed in an unending journey of kirtans (religious story-telling festivals on special occasions) where he would play the role of Shiva, Sita or Radha. That, says Paul, was the beginning of his quest to create drawings of figures in other-worldly garments as well as an exploration about the problems of queer identity in a society dominated by heterosexual norms.","Over the years - and after he lived and studied in the deeply-spiritual and historic city of Benaras where he completed his Master's Degree in Sculpture from the Banaras Hindu University in 2019 - these drawings of other-worldly figures have turned to 'automatic' performances featuring the artist himself. It is in these performances that Paul creates what he describes as a “ritual environment” in which the body and its expressions are considered sacred.","Benaras has had a deep impact on the young artist. While he remembers his stay in the city in unblurred pictures, the vibrant life and spiritual energy remains an inspiration for him. That is because in the holy city of Benaras, people, gods, death and life come in “the most amazing costumes”. Whenever he is in the city, Paul goes out every evening for a walk. That, he candidly maintains, is his studio practice. So, his studio comprises Benaras and all that it contains: the sadhus in saffron and ash, the cows, the dogs and even the goats. He sees them all along with the sights, the smells and sounds that ultimately become part of his body. These coalesce to germinate an idea in his mind and that results in a “performance”.","It is the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown that changed Paul in 2020. It gave him time to look closely at himself “with concentration”. That period saw him experimenting with his art. He researched and experimented with textiles and sewing techniques. That gave rise to his desire to wear dresses, “so I decided to make one for myself”. From that first “dress” many 'sculptural dresses' have been created from painted fabrics and rice paper and used on gender-less forms.","Today, Debashish Paul's work as an artist has evolved to include a wide range of mediums: from sculptural dress to performances, videos and drawings. His quest is to explore homosexuality that he does by treating the body as a landscape to generate new references to queer identities. His sculptural costumes and connected performances provide no references to males or females. They hide and unveil, at the same time, the fragile emotions and desires that prevail in our society."],

She painted at home while working as a construction worker, gradually covering the walls of her home with vibrant figures that resembled plants, people, and animals.","As a result of artist and writer J. Swaminathan's encouragement, the artist moved to Bharat Bhavan in Bhopal, where she continued to develop and gain acclaim for her distinctive style and became the first Bhil artist to use acrylic paint on canvas. Bhuri Bai creates expansive, imaginative settings with human and animal figures using vibrant colour and dotted patterns, in keeping with the ancient methods of Bhil art. According to Bhuri Bai, every time she begins to paint, she thinks back to numerous facets of Bhil culture and existence. Once a particular theme comes to the fore, she brings it to life on her canvas. And her paintings have portrayed every aspect of Bhil life, such as the animals in the forest, the tranquillity of the forest and its trees, gatla (memory pillars), Bhil deities, clothes, jewellery, and gudna (tattoos), houses and granaries, the haat, festivals and dances, and oral storytelling.","We can see the artist's ability to stay true to Bhil art techniques while using them to create a new aesthetic in works like 'Story of the Jungle', in which a whale turns into an aeroplane, and 'Antelopes with Birds', a conventional depiction of an antelope rendered in psychedelic patterning. Bhuri Bai, who in 2021 was given the fourth-highest civilian honour in India—the Padma Shri Award—continues to instruct young women in her village in the customs and methods of Bhil art."],

There, they were exposed to Warli folklore, rituals, and ceremonial Warli paintings, which are distinctive because of their geometric forms and natural and communal themes. The Vayeda brothers have created a technique that adheres to the traditional Warli materials and themes in an effort to 'bring back the history of Warli artforms practised by tribal ancestors.' They use white pigment to create rhythmic alphabet-like forms on surfaces that have been primed with contrasting reddish-brown cow dung. In addition to sharing myths and folktales that have been passed down through the centuries, the brothers also reflect on the state of the modern world using the ancient visual language.","The Vayeda Brothers have been earnestly recording their experiences and observations of communal life in their artwork, and they view themselves as not only painters but also as scholars, storytellers, and educators.The term 'Warli' has been derived from the word 'Waral', which is an underground place where seeds are covered with leaves and stored which further highlights the Warli community's close ties to nature.","The Vayeda Brothers are gently establishing a return to a wholesome, integrated and artistic way of living by opening their studio, incorporating the next generation of artists in their creative process, especially women, who were the founding artists and carriers of this artistic expression, and by promoting green initiatives as part of what they refer to as 'The Jungle Project' to fight the fast industrialization and modernization of the village society.","By participating in international exhibitions and residencies, producing ambitious illustrated book projects, and leaving their mark on massive murals around the globe, they are bringing about a truly innovative vitality.","Two examples of these murals are the facade of the India Art Fair in New Delhi, which will be modified into a 'Forest of the Future' in February 2023, and the Sassoon Docks seascape for the Mumbai Urban Arts Festival.

His work is incredibly vibrant and immensely allegorical, and it is grounded in the artist's own experience. While displacing his presence as an outsider, this unique position allows him to be part of a reality that he sardonically rips through and responds to with his visuality. With Tito's open and direct investigation of death and mortality, the rich and expressive brushwork that brings to life his iconography responds to Cesar A. Cruz's famous maxim, 'Art should shock the comfortable and comfort the disturbed.'","Tito's visual landscape, which is immersed in Christian mythology, is plagued by the spectre of a chaotic and riotous existence that has seen violent upheavals, intergroup conflict, and personal tragedies. Tito's paintings grow explicit and disturbing as he sharply critiques the politics of his surroundings, overwhelming the viewer with apprehension and uneasiness while also presenting an emotional yet persevering journey that has only just begun.","Tito is a graduate of the College of Fine Arts in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, and the MS University Baroda in Gujarat. His work has appeared in a number of group exhibitions, including the Student's Biennale in Kochi (2016), the annual exhibitions at the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi (2016, 2019, 2021, and 2022), the Bose Krishnamachari-curated exhibition 'Lokame Tharavadu' in Alappuz Relics of a Divine Land, his first solo exhibition, was displayed at Academy Art Gallery in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala (2020).

Born and brought up in Mumbai, the 1980 graduate from the JJ School of Art took up a job at the Bombay Port Trust. He worked there till 1995 when he received the Charles Wallace scholarship to study in Glasgow, Scotland. The time with the Port Trust was well spent since Gawde's paintings reflected his surroundings: Bombay's dockyards and wharves. It is no wonder that he confides that the logic of his paintings is “to strip the over layers partially, so that earlier histories may be revealed.”","In addition, his year-long stint in Glasgow where he painted for a year gave Gawde and his work not only a spirit of contemplation but also increased his productivity, He held shows in London's ARKS Gallery and at the Mackintosh Museum in Glasgow.","The artist brings together an amalgamation of unusual perspective married to a high degree of aesthetic sensibility which is rooted in the tradition of being contemporary. A Mumbaikar, his art reflects the constant transformation that the metropolis goes through. Like his Bombay dockyard memories in art, Gawde has his roots in the contemporaneity that symbolises the city of Mumbai.","His artistic life history includes important stops at the 53rd Venice Biennale with the two-ton kinetic piece 'Alliteration' in the Arsenale 'Making Worlds'. This artwork was also re-exhibited at Kunstmuseum Bochum, Germany in an exhibition titled 'Sparsha' curated by Thomas Hensolt in 2014.","Gawde's focus on the difference between reality and perception, as well as their connections and extensions make him a much sought after artist internationally. He uses sculptures, paintings, and kinetic installations to highlight the absurd, paradoxical, and contradictory nature of life with different sets of visually stimulating opposites such as, soft vs. hard, round vs. sharp, etc. The artist uses methods that are different from others. For example, he uses trowels and scrapers used by masons and house-painters when he applies paints. The technique gives his paintings a layered depth.","While his artistic vocabulary transcends geographic regions and cultures, he vibes with the local context and is in sync with international trends. His technique of expression brings a touch of humor and charm but also encourages philosophical reflection.","Gawde has also done several commissioned public art projects, including a 3-tonne mechanized sculpture, 'Galileo and his friends left me with these moons…' (2012), as part of a HSR (high speed railway) Project by the Taiwan government."],

So, there are three-dimensional installations in wood, terracotta, fiberglass and thread.Toying with everyday objects around her, Aggarwal's work elevates these several notches exploring gender-related and basic human issues. She connects these issues to the society that we live in showcasing the responses that arise from these. Art for her, as she put it rather forthrightly, “is an emotional presentiment to our inner and outer situation, locating it amidst several socio-cultural and political contexts. My work has developed from small intimate and intricate paintings to large three-dimensional sculptural installations in wood, terracotta, fiberglass, wire and thread. The thread has been explored in various ways - sewing, crocheting, stitching, painting and also using them in installations for the past 15 years”.Aggarwal's work delves deeply in women - often questioning the jejune and repetitive feminine responsibilities of beautification, providing love, repairing both objects and relations, and much more that we often pretend to overlook. Out spring the feelings of emptiness that women in families feel in the works of art. Incidentally, these feelings are more often than not due to the unsaid expectations that a feminine soul feels.Aggarwal's use of the thread speaks volumes: it can be a social link between relations as well as conflicts, and at other times becomes a blood vessel. These threads create patterns or as she put it, these are “shocking and compelling, twisting and turning, infinitely into a cycle of decay and repair. 'I often employ the images of sewing, knitting, using the related tools in my work to emphasize connotations with warmth, home, protection and childhood, and also to revisit and reexamine the cultural preconceptions surrounding it'.","Aggarwal also uses everyday objects as focal points of challenge and inquiry. The tools are bent out of shape and made completely useless. For example, the scissors can no longer cut the entangled threads while the hammer is twisted and cannot be used to beat anything to shape. These, according to her, symbolise the idea of the self as a tool that moulds and remoulds itself to counter the inner and outer challenges that it faces. At the same time, these disfigured instruments become symbols of pathos and humor. “As symbols of functionality, from personal, political or societal standpoints, they remain constantly challenged, twisted, distorted, broken or perverted for convenience and greed,” says Aggarwal. At the India Art Fair, Shivani Aggarwal's 'Within Confines' shows a novel way of looking at emptiness. Working during the pandemic, the artist has a wide range of creations: from outlines on paper to heavy wooden sculptures and intricate copper-wire yarns, each hand-crocheted by the artist."],

For Samat, it is crucial to live out what one feels from within, without restraint or fear. Each one of her pieces resonate as an avatar and is vividly coloured and lavishly decorated. The sculptures are totems to various family members, with the pieces symbolizing personal stories. Handmade ropes dangle from the rakes' radiating armatures. Random objects are turned formal, cultural, and figurative. Forks and spoons act as a warp, a pair of plastic funnels double as breasts, and cassette tapes are hung from 80s-style neckpieces that resemble chains.

These are now, perhaps, being superseded in the big cities by new apartment buildings with their globalised aesthetic exteriors.","The artist received a BA in visual art from Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, in 2001 and a MFA from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara, in 2003. Working in Vadodara, India, Karmakar's photorealist paintings depict identity, memory, and place.","The artist has carefully researched and meticulously rendered depictions of domestic items that highlight social and temporal idiosyncrasies of modern India and its legacy of colonization by the British Raj.","The six canvases that compose 'Passage', for example, were created in response to the living- and dining-rooms of a nineteenth-century residence on Governor's Island in New York City. Known for his specificity and tender attention to detailing, Karmakar shows empathy and understanding of the universal power of a warm and safe home and the possessions it contains.","The artist also excels at mimesis. The true content of 'Everyday', for instance, is not the painting's illusionism but rather its staking and receipt of time. 'Surface 7, 2021', a gridded rectangle of a deteriorating indigo wall, painstakingly describes a process of peels, cracks, and stains, while its interest fixes firmly to what remains through such passage."],

        info: ["Chandan Bez Baruah is an Assamese artist who excels in woodcuts and printmaking. He completed his BFA in Printmaking from Government Art College Guwahati, Assam, and MFA in Printmaking from Visva-Bharati University Santiniketan, West Bengal.","Today Baruah lives and works in Delhi-NCR but continues to dream about forests of the north-east. A childhood love and a memory of the landscapes of Assam, these forests help the artist to fly away from the hustle and bustle of the metropolis he has made his home. The dark and wooded trees provide him with a retreat at times of loneliness. These forests—Baruah's refuge—exist everywhere, permeating from varied geographies of history, culture, and contemporary conflict. He finds solace in creating images out of wooden boards because he feels that the wood of the boards demand revelation. And, the love he pours in to create these images highlights his intimacy to the trees, the undergrowth and, of course, the forests. It is in these images that Baruah holds our hand and takes up on a trek through the jungle and his specially chosen haunts, often asking us to just observe his secret treasures and wishes. His prints of the forests are views from the artist's eyes. They tell stories of the young man who accompanied Indian army men who needed a native pair of eyes for a guide. It is in these images that the artist records the chirping of the birds, the buzz of the bees and the croaking of the frogs. He appeals to our eyes as ears to see and hear—the falling of trees, for example—all the goings-on in the 'silence' of the forests.","Baruah's forests—though they show old trees—reflect the postmodern approach to landscapes. He works on a series in what has been described as “a confined and comprehensive manner”. Speaking about an exhibit If A Tree Falls (Somewhere In Northeast India) he had stressed that one of the reasons for creating prints was 'to see the insight terrain of the marginalised or the subaltern, and to situate Postmodern landscapes as encountering Romantic theory'. For him, the woodcut prints that he creates, are his digital photographs. Carved with extreme precision and care, these woodcuts are born from the digital photographs that the artist has clicked for his reference. What is striking is the highly skilled hand-craftsmanship that goes into the creation of the prints since they depict a chaos in the serenity of the forests.","Unlike other printmakers, Baruah's forests do not have humans or wildlife. He remains a solitary observer much like what American photographer Ansel Adamas once commented when he was told there were no human beings in his photographs, “There are always two people: the photographer and the viewer.” Indeed, Chandan Bez Baruah's monochromatic woodcuts have more than one human being, the viewer. There is a lot to seek and understand in the play of light on the trees: these forests have borne witness to history, culture, and contemporary conflict for centuries."],

She received her degree in painting from Sir J.J. School of Art in 1986, and since the 1990s, she has been acknowledged as one of her generation's most well-known painters. In her works, she challenges the limits of watercolour on hostile surfaces in terms of scale and texture. Her paintings usually contrast hard-edged charcoal incursions with soft, spontaneous watercolour blotches and stains and her artworks frequently address socio-economic and cultural events as they unfold in a subtly critical manner. Imbued with complex symbolism, the details in her paintings depict the disparity between appearance and reality.","The veteran artist has developed her emblematic visual language and scale throughout the years, layering references from literature, European cinemas, Japanese Ukio-e prints, Renaissance masters, miniature paintings, and, more recently, artworks uploaded on Instagram. She has also been influenced by myths from all across the world as well as medieval devotional poetry and Gujarati folklore. Cultural scholar Nancy Adajania has remarked that when viewing Dodiya's self-reflective pieces, viewers 'encounter a palimpsest of art history, cinema, haute couture, and private joke.' In Dodiya's paintings, mythical women like Daphne, Penelope, and Arachne have featured as protagonists, expressing ideas of vulnerability or participating in the rhythm of labour. Women are frequently at the heart of autobiographical and interpersonal relationships in her works. Another distinct attribute of her artworks is her propensity for anthropomorphic imagery, reflecting her interest in the field of psychoanalysis and the human psyche.","She has been featured in a number of private and public collections, including those at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Zabludowicz Collection in Florida, the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi and Mumbai, the Jehangir Nicholson Art Foundation in Mumbai, the Ishara Art Foundation and the Prabhakar Collection in Dubai, the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in New Delhi, and the Devi Art Foundation in Gurgaon, among many more."],

The female body is frequently a topic of discussion, control, criticism, and violence within India's patriarchal social system. According to colonial-era Victorian standards that have since been appropriated into a neo-fascist moral code that emphasises derivation from indigenous values drawn from old religious texts, public displays of nudity are discouraged. She mocks the hypocrisy of traditions which exclude women from their homes during their menstrual cycles because they are viewed as dirty while cow dung cakes are used as fuel and in religious ceremonies to purify oneself since it is deemed pure.","For millennia, Indian miniatures have consistently portrayed sensual forms and varied facets of nudity, especially when incorporated into the history and narrative of a nation or culture. She was rejected from a museum exhibition where the exclusion of a budding young artist was justified by the nudity in her works. Her stitched pieces in a different group show called Outsider praised the body of a woman who would have been the target of body shaming.
